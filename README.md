The goal of this challenge is to use  Reinforcement Learning in Power Grid management by designing RL agents to automate the control of the power grid.
The dataset used in this challenge is from pypownet, made by Marvin Lerousseau, it is a simulator that is able to emulate a power grid of 
any size and electrical properties subject to a set of temporal injections for discretized time-steps.
